# Replication for the Global Data Plane
Distributed Replication for a Specialized Database

There has been an explosion in the number of smart devices connected via the Internet to augment people's everyday life. The [Global Data Plane](https://gdp.cs.berkeley.edu/redmine/) (GDP) is a new infrastructure design which tries to address the challenges presented by such a vast and broad array of devices by introducing a higher layer of abstraction. We present an anti-entropy mechanism which ensures that data is replicated on multiple GDP log servers and user APIs. We modeled many of our decision to support a highly write available system. Evaluations show that our replication system can recover from large loss of log servers and has significantly better usage of bandwidth than a naive system. 

Replication for the Global Data Plane is the result of a course paper for [CS 262: Advanced Topics in Computer Systems](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kubitron/courses/cs262a-F18/index.html). 

Packages Summaries:
* `logserver` provides access to the functionality of a GDP log server. We have simulated a log server with a SQLite3 database.
* `loggraph` provides an abstracted view of the records in the log server as a graph with the ability to read and write records.
* `policy` dictates what replicas communicate with each other to determine what records to serve.
* `peers` abstracts how replicas commuicate data with each other
* `daemon` when to send heartbeats with peers and who to send them to
